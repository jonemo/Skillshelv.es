<h1>Get started!</h1>

<p>Having hesitations about signing up? Or just not sure how to go about this?</p>

<h2>Why should I spend 5 minutes of my life to build a Skillshelf?</h2>

<p>Reason No 1: To show off your skills. You've probably been at a friend's home or office and were surprised to find a certain title in their bookshelf. You probably had no idea that your friend had a knack for Artifical Intelligence, but the Prolog and Lisp books gave it away. I hope, you aren't hiding your bookshelf either: Most job openings are filled through personal networks these days and it's important that people know what your skills are! Skillshelv.es is your chance to show off your technical interests and expertise online to more people.</p>

<p>Reason No 2: To work on your skills. Right now Skillshelv.es is still in development but once everything is fully refined, the site will give you hints on which books might help you get even more specialiced in your fields of expertise. Forget about Amazon where they recommend one beginner level book after another &mdash; Skillshelv.es will tell you which books take your current reading further by suggesting even more specialized books.</p>

<h2>Why Skillshelv.es might be useless for you</h2>

<p>First things first: Skillshelv.es will currently only work for you, if you have read at least a few books published by O'Reilly Media. If you don't have any, you can still sign up and pretend to have read these books, but Skillshelv.es might not be quite as useful to you. Not sure if you have read O'Reilly books? Walk over to your bookshelf now and see if you can find any!</p>

<h2>Why you won't need to remember a password for Skillshelv.es</h2>

<p>Back from you trip to the bookshelf? Skillshelv.es won't give you another password to remember. You can sign in through OpenID with your Google, Yahoo or MyOpenID logins. If you are already signed in to any of these services, you won't even have to type your password. Convenient, eh? You can read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Skillshelv.es asks you questions</h2>

<p>When you are logged in, the site will ask you for a username and an email address (based on your OpenID credentials there will be a suggestions which you are free to ignore). The username will end up in the URL of your public Skillshelf like so: http://skillshelv.es/USERNAME. The email address will only be used if the login through OpenID ever fails to help recover your account.</p>

<h2>How you'll build your Skillshelf</h2>

<p>Once we have you set up with a username, you'll have to manually enter all the O'Reilly books you have. Unless you have a room full of O'Reilly books, that shouldn't take too long. As you begin typing a title, book covers will be shown to speed up the process of filling your skillshelf.</p>
