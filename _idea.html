<h1>Idea</h1>

<p>The idea to make Skillshelv.es was born after <a href="http://www.fluidinfo.com">Fluidinfo</a> imported a large proportion of all books ever published by O'Reilly Media into their FluidDB and offered developers a prize if they come up with an exciting application for the writable API. My idea is pretty simple: You list which O'Reilly books are in your bookshelf and skillshelv.es analyzes your bookshelf to find out what skills you have.  </p>

<p>That's the idea behind skillshelv.es. If you want to know more you should sign up and build your own skillshelf. You could also check out <a href="http://neubertify.tumblr.com">my blog</a> where I intend to write up some more details about this project once this thing is fully operational.</p>
