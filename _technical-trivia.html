<h1>Technical Trivia</h1>

<p>{{skillshelves_logo|safe}} started as a submission to <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/03/api-competition.html" title="O'Reilly Radar blog post announcing the competition">O'Reilly's &ldquo;Wirtable API Competition&rdquo;</a>. To be able to announce my participation in the contest in style and document all the technical decisions, I finally set up <a href="http://neubertify.tumblr.com/" title="my blog">that personal blog</a> and <a href="http://neubertify.tumblr.com/post/4673761476/hello-fluidinfo-api-competition">threw my hat in the ring</a>. In my usual no-last-minute-panic-no-fun approach I had an acceptable first version of Skillshelv.es up and running on <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sunday+April+17+23%3A59+PST">Sunday April 17 23:59 PST</a> and have been refining things since then.</p>

<p><a href="http://neubertify.tumblr.com/post/4724160575/fluidinfo-api-contest-design-decisions">I posted an in-depth writeup of all the upfront design decisions over on my blog</a>. You can read it there or get the gist in a list:</p> 

<ul>
	<li>skillshelv.es stores almost all its data in <a href="http://www.fluidinfo.com/about/" title="About Fluidinfo">Fluidinfo's data store</a></li>
	<li>everything here is written in Python</li>
	<li>accordingly this site uses <a href="https://github.com/fluidinfo/fluidinfo.py" title="Fluidinfo.py">the extremly handy Python library for fluidinfo</a></li>
	<li>skillshelv.es runs on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" title="Google App Engine main page">Google App Engine</a></li>
	<li>setting up a custom domain for Google App Engine took two days of hard work</li>
	<li>some functionality had to reluctantly be implemented in Javascript (I'll link to a blog post about this as soon as it's written)</li>
	<li>other parts of the project were implemented in Javascript using <a href="http://www.jquery.com" title="jQuery website">jQuery</a> by choice</li>
	<li>just under 2500 O'Reilly books were manually tagged with topics by me (at an average rate of approx 250 per hour)</li>
	<li>the total man hour count spent making the initial release of this site  approximately <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=96" title="Wolframalpha supplied trivia about the number ninety-six">96</a> (not counting said two days of making the domain work with Google App Engine)</li>
</ul>
